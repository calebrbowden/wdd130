    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>I came up with the content and images with the help of AI.</p>
    <p>I communicated with my developer using Microsoft Teams. There weren't any issues with communication.</p>
    <p>My developer did not meet my expectations for my site.</p>
    <p>Next time I hire a team to do a project for me I will be more specific in what I want.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I communicated with my junior devs using Microsoft Teams.</p>
    <p>I communicated with my client using Microsoft Teams. There weren't any issues.</p>
    <p>I shared the site with the client using Microsoft Teams.</p>
    <p>My experience with managing my site with GitHub was good. GitHub made it easy to share code between developers.</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I communicated with my team lead using Microsoft Teams and text messages. There weren't any issues.</p>
    <p>I knew what was expected of me for each site.</p>
    <p>I was able to contribute to my sites.</p>
    <p>I did not run into any issues with GitHub and adding my changes to the sites.</p>

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part of this project was coordinating with everyone in my groups. I was able to overcome this challenge.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed working on multiple different websites.</p>
    <p>If I could do the project again I would start earlier.</p>
    <p>I do not feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience because I saw how hard it is to coordinate with everyone in a group.</p>
